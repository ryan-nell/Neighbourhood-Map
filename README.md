# MyReads Project

The neighborhood map application is a single page web application that implements google maps API to display different locations using markers.

The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamentals of React.js by as creating and rendering components, using Props to display data and State to update the data. This give us the opportunity to explore
and experiment with external APIS and using fetch to request the Data.
This is a project that is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree by Udacity.
